# Install Git

A video demonstration of installing Git on a computer running Windows 10 is available at: https://youtu.be/4Y46oqbct-8

## Preinstall Check

Before installing Git, it's not a bad idea to check if it's already installed.

* Open a terminal (Mac) or command prompt (Windows)
  * Open a terminal on a Mac https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QROX039ckO8
  * Open the command prompt in Windows https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE9WgNr3OjM
* At the command prompt run the code `git --version`
* If you don't see a Git version like `git version 2.37.0.windows.1` (your version may not be exactly the same), then you need to download and install Git. (We'll learn more about what it does later.)

## Download and Install Git

* Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads
* Download the correct installer for your operating system. 
* Run the install program after it downloads.
  * I used the default settings for most options with a couple of exceptions.
  * At time index 4:00 (4 minutes) I selected Notepad as the default editor. Notepad is on all Windows computers. You can probably just use the default choice on a Mac.
  * At time index 4:27 I selected Override the default branch name for new repositories and left the name "main" in the window.
* Post a screen shot in the discussion or come to office hours if you run into problems.

## Confirm Installation

* Open a terminal (Mac) or command line (Windows)
* At the command prompt run the code `git --version`
* If you don't see a Git version like `git version 2.37.0.windows.1` (your version may not be exactly the same), then you need to download and install Git. (We'll learn more about what it does later.)

## Turn in Assignment

* Turn in a screenshot of your terminal or command prompt window showing your Git version.
